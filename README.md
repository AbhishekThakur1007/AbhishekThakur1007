I'm a software engineer who is passionate about developing android applications. I really enjoy learning new frameworks related to mobile. I am proficient in Ionic and currently learning Flutter. Also, in my spare time I read code and undestand different architecture patterns in use and how different use cases are handled to become more literate, numerate and code-savvy. 

Skills: KOTLIN / JETPACK / SQL / ARCHITECTURE PATTERN 

💼 Android Developer at Edios Software Solutions.
